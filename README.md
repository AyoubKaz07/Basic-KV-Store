This project aims to get my hands dirtier doing systems in c++

## Description

The project is divided into several stages, each covering a critical aspect of database development:

1. **Basic In-Memory Key/Value Store:** Creation of a simple, in-memory key/value store with experimentation on concurrent data reading and writing mechanisms.

2. **Disk-Based Storage Engine for Read-Only Key/Value Data:** Development of a persistent storage engine for random reads of key/value data. (Main focus)

I think this was the wrong way to do it. we go next

## Checklist

- [✅] Basic In-Memory Key/Value Store
- [✅] Disk-Based Storage Engine for Read-Only Key/Value Data
STOPPED HERE I'LL DO A KEY VALUE STORE WITH AN LSM TREE STORAGE ENGINE INSTEAD (LEARNED SOMETHING THO)
